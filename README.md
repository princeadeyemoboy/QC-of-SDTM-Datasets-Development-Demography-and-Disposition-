# Disposition_Dataset_Validation
- Project Title: 	Disposition (DS) Dataset Validation
- Description: 		Generating DS (SDTM) dataset as per CDISC standard by using raw DS, Rand & 
Comvar dataset and validate it with primary Disposition dataset by writing 
independent code in SAS.
- SAS Version:		SAS onDemand for Academics
## Introduction 
The project involves validating an already developed disposition dataset using the input SDTM datasets and comparing both.
- Structure of DS: One record per disposition status or protocol milestone per 
subject.

## Logical Follow.
- Call initial.sas to set up directory structure.
- Sort DM, Rand & Comvar dataset by using USUBJID and Merge with DS 
dataset and take requisites Variables as per specs.
- Finally sort it by USUBJID, DSSTDTC, and DSDECOD.
-  Compare it with the primary Disposition dataset
## Inputs
    â€¢DS.sas7bdat
    â€¢Rand.sas7bdat
    â€¢Comvar.sas7bdat
          
## Tasks
	As explained in the Requirement Specification (RSD) ðŸ”½

|SN|Variable Name 	|Variable Label |Data Type|CDISC Notes 	|Algorithm|
|---|---------------|---------------|---------|---------------|---------|
|1|STUDYID| Study Identifier| Char| Unique identifier for a study.| Direct Mapping|
|2|DOMAIN |Domain Abbreviation|Char |Two-character abbreviation for the domain.| "DS"|
|3|USUBJID| Unique Subject Identifier |Char|Identifier used to uniquely identify a subject across all studies for all applications or submissions involving the product. This must be a unique number, and could be a compound identifier formed by concatenating STUDYID-SITEID-SUBJID.|Direct Mapping(DS.STUDYID concatenated '-'concatenated SITEID concatenated'-'concatenated DS.SUBJID)|
|4|DSSEQ |Sequence Number| Num|Derived. Sequence Number is given to ensure the uniqueness of subject records within a domain.|Sequence Number = Number of subjects who participated in the study|
|5|DSTERM| Term for the Disposition Event|DSTERM|Verbatim name of the event or protocol milestone. Some terms in DSTERM will match DSDECOD, but others, such as â€•Subject movedâ€– will map to controlled terminology in DSDECOD, such as  â€•LOST TO FOLLOW-UP.|RAND.DSTERM,  DM.DSTERM, DS.DSTERM (as DSTERM is not available in DM dataset, it is created by considering all DM data as 'Informed consent obtained')|
|6|DSDECOD| Standardized Disposition Term |DSDECOD|Controlled terminology for the name of disposition event or protocol milestone. Examples of protocol milestones: INFORMED CONSENT OBTAINED, RANDOMIZED|RAND.DSDECOD, DM.DSDECOD, DS.DSDECOD (as DSDECOD is not available in DM dataset, it is created by considering all DM data as 'Informed consent obtained')|
|7|DSCAT| Category for Disposition Event| Char|Used to define a category of related records. DSCAT is now an â€•Expected variable. DSCAT was permissible in SDTMIG 3.1.1 and earlier versions. The change from â€•permissible to â€•expected is based on the requirement to distinguish protocol milestones and/or other events from disposition events. DSCAT may be null if there are only â€•disposition events; however, it is recommended that DSCAT always be populated.|Derived from example given in IG which shows which data will comes under what category example : Protocol Milestone,Disposition Event, Other events.|
|8|DSSCAT|Subcategory for disposition event| Char| A further categorization of disposition event.||
|9|DSSTDTC| Start Date/Time of disposition event |Char| |RAND.DSSTDTC, DM.DSSTDTC, DS.DSSTDTC|
|10|DSSTDY| Study Day of Start of Disposition Event |Num |Study day of start of event relative to the sponsor-defined RFSTDTC. Perm|If DSSTDTC1 ge _RFSTDTC THEN DSSTDY=(ds.DSSTDTC1-comvar._RFSTDTC)+1; ELSE DSSTDY=ds.DSSTDTC1-comvar._RFSTDTC|
